NEXT STEPS:
(manpower update function done)
(allies done with does_border function)
(player attack done)
(testing done)
(coded in a check to make sure the ID three letters will never be the same)
(coded computer turns)
1 - Code a win check
2 - Polish
3 - code developer commands as secret commands have -> add_pop, force_ally, annex
4 - final debug and polish
5 - Game balance
6 - Get ideas for version 2 -> nations scores and a score-based victory,
able to release dead nations, populations rooted in tiles so add on (less manpower from them if non core)

BUG TO FIX:
Sometimes allies dont update that theyre not in the game anymore for computers
This is really weird and not obvious
NARROWED DOWN:
sometimes when the computer attacks, the indexes are not all checked. there must be a logical flaw in the code for changing indices
after an invasion somewhere
ADDITIONALLY these faulty allies can then end up on the allies list twice, causing them to take double losses
